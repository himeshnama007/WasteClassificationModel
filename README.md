# Waste Classification Model

This project is a **Waste Classification System** that uses a deep learning model to classify waste into different categories such as paper, e-waste, organic, plastic, metal, and glass. The system is built using TensorFlow and Flask, providing a user-friendly web interface for waste classification.

## Example Output

Here is an example of the waste classification system in action:

## Project Overview

### Features:

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload an image of waste material through the web interface.
- **Waste Classification**: The system predicts the category of the waste using a trained deep learning model.
- **Responsive Web Interface**: A user-friendly interface built with HTML, CSS, and Flask.
- **Dynamic Background**: A visually appealing background image for the web application.
- **Data Augmentation**: The model uses data augmentation techniques to improve accuracy.

### Waste Categories:

1. Paper
2. E-Waste
3. Organic
4. Plastic
5. Metal
6. Glass

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites:

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Required Python libraries:
  - Flask
  - TensorFlow
  - NumPy

### Steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/himeshnama007/WasteClassificationModel.git
   cd waste-classification-model
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Train the model (if needed):

   - Run model.py or wastemodel.ipynb to train the model and save it as `model.h5`.
4. Start the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
5. Open your browser and navigate to:

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```
6. Upload an image of waste and view the classification result.
